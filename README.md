- 👋 Hi, I’m Collin!
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical and software applications. I love anything to do with computers but also love doing physical hands-on work outside of the office.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning website development and software engineering through The Odin Project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of information to do with coding as it is a passion I have for a career.
